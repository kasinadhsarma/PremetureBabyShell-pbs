# PBS Software Architecture Design

## 1. System Overview
The PBS software architecture implements a distributed edge-cloud hybrid system for premature baby monitoring and care, leveraging Model Context Protocol (MCP) for enhanced AI model interaction. The system utilizes edge computing for real-time processing and cloud integration for data analytics and storage, with MCP providing standardized context for all AI operations.
